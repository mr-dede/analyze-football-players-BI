# Analysis of football player metrics with power bi

The two files were created by Power BI. The uploaded database came from the following source: https://fbref.com/
I selected metrics that make sense for a midfield player.

Analysis and conclusion:

When analyzing the player Hicham Boudaoui, we notice a significant evolution over the seasons, especially in terms of efficiency in tackling. He has transitioned from a tackle success rate of around 40% to approximately 80% in the current season. Furthermore, he demonstrates excellent accuracy in short and medium-distance passes, making him an ideal fit for midfield players. Additionally, he excels in creating goal-scoring opportunities, averaging more than 2 per game.
Despite having a moderately effective dribbling ability, around 50%, his contribution to goal creation is relatively modest. This suggests a profile more inclined towards defensive midfield rather than offensive play. This distinction becomes evident when comparing him to the other two players, Gomes and Zakaria. Boudaoui exhibits markedly higher tackle success rates compared to his counterparts, while displaying the lowest goal creation rate. This analysis reinforces his identification as a defensive-minded midfielder in comparison to the other two mentioned players.
